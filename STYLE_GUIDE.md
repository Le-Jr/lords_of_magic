# Style Guide — Lords of Logic

Visual direction spec. This is a design brief, not an implementation —
the goal is for opencode to read this and write the CSS/components
from it, not for you to copy something ready-made.

## Direction

Monochrome MS-DOS terminal. The game is dev trivia, so the visual
reference comes from computing history itself, not generic retro
aesthetics. There's a single recurring signature element: a Pong ball
bouncing between two paddles — it can show up as hero decoration, a
loading indicator, or a progress indicator inside a match, but it's
always the same element, never a second animated motif competing with
it.

## Color

Strict grayscale, no hue (no phosphor green, no amber).

| Role | Approximate value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| Background | pure black | always the background, no exceptions |
| Primary text | slightly off-white (not pure `#fff` — avoids glare on black) | body text, headings |
| Secondary text | mid gray | captions, disabled state, supporting text |
| Borders/decoration | dark gray | dividers, ASCII-style frames |
| Active/hover/focus state | full inversion (background and text swap) | never introduce a new color to signal state |

If error/success needs to be distinguished, do it with type weight or
explicit text (`ERROR:`, `OK:`), never with color — that's what keeps
the product genuinely monochrome.

## Typography

- **Display** (large headings, h1, boot prompt): a CRT/bitmap terminal
  face — e.g. VT323 from Google Fonts. Large sizes only; illegible in
  running body text.
- **Body and UI** (paragraphs, buttons, labels, menus): a readable
  monospace — e.g. IBM Plex Mono. Everything that isn't a large
  heading uses this.
- A clear size scale with defined steps (caption → body → h3 → h2 →
  h1), no loose values scattered through the code.

## Layout

- Corners are always square — zero `border-radius` on any element.
  Square frames, like a DOS window.
- Main content centered at a "terminal" width (not a marketing-site
  width — narrower, evoking an 80-column terminal).
- Dividers as a dashed rule, not a bare unstyled `<hr>`.

## Component patterns (behavior, not code)

- **Prompt line**: used as a header/breadcrumb on every page (e.g.
  `C:\LORDS_OF_LOGIC\PLAY>`), with a blinking block cursor at the end.
- **Menu item**: any list of actions or primary navigation follows the
  DOS boot-menu pattern — a marker (`>`) to the left of the text,
  uppercase text for navigation commands. On hover or keyboard focus,
  colors invert (background and text swap) instead of changing hue.
- **Command menu**: a menu of navigation commands is a keyboard-roving
  widget — TAB enters the menu once (a single tab stop, no per-item
  tabbing), ARROW UP/DOWN moves the active command, HOME/END jump to
  first/last, and ENTER runs it. Only the active command is in the tab
  order. Focus and hover share the same inversion treatment, so the
  selected command is always visibly inverted.
- **Content box**: container with a square 2px border, no shadow, no
  gradient.
- **Ranking list**: tabular data rendered as a content-box `<table>`.
  Uppercase secondary-text column headers, dashed rule under the
  header row, body rows in `text-sm`; numeric columns (rank, XP,
  matches) right-aligned with `tabular-nums` so figures line up like
  terminal output.
- **Keyboard focus cursor**: same visual treatment as hover — a solid
  block inverting colors. This replaces the browser's default outline
  and should never be removed without that substitute.

Before creating a new component, check whether one of the patterns
above already solves it. If a genuinely new component is needed,
document the pattern here after building it, so future sessions reuse
it instead of reinventing it.

## Motion

- One continuous animation per screen at most — the Pong ball (or the
  blinking cursor, which is nearly static). Don't stack multiple
  decorative animations on the same screen.
- No soft "ease-in-out" decorative easing. Movement is linear or
  stepped, like a real terminal — not like a modern smooth interface.
- All animation must respect the user's reduced-motion OS preference.
  This should be configured globally once, not repeated per component.

## Copy

- English is the default and first-built language for every feature.
  Navigation commands in UPPERCASE (`PLAY`, `LOGIN`, `RANKING`);
  running text in normal lowercase.
- A Portuguese (pt-BR) language toggle is a planned future feature —
  see `AGENTS.md`. Don't hardcode English strings directly inside
  components; keep UI copy in a single place (e.g. a strings/constants
  module) so adding the toggle later doesn't require touching every
  component.
- Decorative comments/captions can use a code-comment style (`//
  text`) to reinforce the command-line aesthetic.
- Error or empty-state messages: direct, in a system's voice
  (`ERROR: MATCH NOT FOUND`), never in an apologetic human voice.

## Accessibility — non-negotiable

- High contrast is natural in this scheme (black/white), but any text
  carrying essential information uses the primary text color, never
  the secondary one.
- Keyboard focus always visible, with the same treatment as hover.
- Reduced motion always respected.
